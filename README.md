# dbmigrator
This is a Java tool for exporting DB tables between different schemas/databases. 
Offers a GUI to configure the process. 
The result is a series of .php scripts that can be launched to perform data export/import.
Supports the following DB: mysql, oracle, sql server. 
Generated scripts work inside SugarCRM but can be customized to avoid use of SugarCRM objects/functions.
## TODO
I need this program to generate php scripts that use native DB function. ATM they work only in SugarCRM environments.
