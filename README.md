# dbmigrator
Tool for exporting DB tables between different schemas/databases. 
Offers a GUI to configure the process. 
The result is a series of .php files which can be launched to perform data export/import.
Supports the following DB: mysql, oracle, sql server. Works out of the box for SugarCRM but scripts can be easily configured to avoid use of SugarCRM objects.
